			<p class="content">Chicken sure is great isn't it? It's heart healthy
			and quite delicious. We prepare it any way you'd like it, fried, roasted
			boiled, blended, spoon fed, you name it! We recommend that you leave that
			you leave the skin on. After all, without some kind of skin in the mix,
			what is the point of eating chicken? But wait, we said chicken should be
			healthy right? Well we will coat that skin in any kind of powder
			you'd like. That way it will be healthy. At that point we cannot
			guarantee the taste. It could taste like yesterday's chicken, or maybe
			even chicken your son didn't agree with! That is a gamble you'll just have
			to take. Chef's specialty is the chicken gyro. It comes with all the normal
			fixins. We make our pita in house. You'll have to try it to believe it.
			We won't make it any way but our way when it comes to the gyro, so ignore
			everything you just read!

			<p class="content">Beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeef.
				Seriously what is more American than beef? We dedicated an entire
				section of our country to raising the damn things. Have you been
				to the midwest? You know, that section of America between the Mojave
				Desert and the Mississippi? Yeah, there is nothing but cow out there.
				We raise these things by the billions, and we do it better than any
				other country on Earth. Hell, where else can you buy 128oz of prime rib
				and get your face on a wall for it? No where else, that's where. We do
				our beef three ways: medium rare, rare, and blue. If you want it any other
				way, well you came to the wrong damn restaurant. We have one hot damn
				wood fired grill in the back. It'll cook your steak better than any other
				steak you have ever had, but don't hold us to it. If you want it mooing,
				it'll come trotting to the table. Heck, we will let you kill the cow yourself.
				Steak is serious business. Being American is serious business. Grilling
				is serious business.

			<p class="content">I'm not sure how we got Sushi in the mix with chicken
				and beef, but here we are. We've got a whole bunch of rolls. Salmon roll,
				avocado roll, california roll, cucumber roll, eel roll, shrimp roll,
				shrimp tempura roll, bagel roll, roll roll, dragon roll, dynamite roll,
				hand roll, on a roll, volcano roll, tuna roll, spicy tuna roll, fried
				spicy tuna roll, crab roll, crab stick roll, all the crab roll, uni
				roll, beef roll, boiled chicken roll, blended chicken roll, yesterday's
				roll, tomorrow's roll, seawater roll, rice roll, nori roll, big mac roll,
				king crab roll, rolly polly roll. The list goes on. That guy from Forrest
				Gump could do a whole movie on us. Thing is, we've got you covered. Anything
				you ask sushi wise, we can do it, or we can go find a guy that can. You
				came here to eat and we came here to feed you. Just get ready to open
				that gullet because everyone knows that sushi isn't filling. Bombs away.
				You're going to eat at least 200 pieces when you're here. Get ready, son.
